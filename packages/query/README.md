### Effect-TS Query

This package is a work in progress port of `zio-query`

## Install

We recommend the usage of `yarn` and if you hf `yarn workspaces` that handles by default hoisting of dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @effect-ts/system @effect-ts/tracing-utils @effect-ts/core @effect-ts/monocle @effect-ts/morphic @effect-ts/query fast-equals fast-check
```
